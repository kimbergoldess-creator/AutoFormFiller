# AutoFormFiller

## Summary
AutoFormFiller is a project designed to simplify the repetitive task of filling in forms (such as bid applications, business documents, or standardized forms).  
Instead of manually copying the same information over and over, this tool automates the process, reduces human errors, and saves valuable time.

## Features

- Automatically fill in fields of predefined form templates.  
- Customizable templates for different form types.  
- Logging and validation of completed forms before submission.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `pyautogui` (or others depending on the approach).
